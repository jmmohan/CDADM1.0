## **Overview**
Adversarial attacks exploit vulnerabilities in machine learning models by perturbing input data to produce incorrect predictions. The CDADM framework identifies shared adversarial patterns across domains and mitigates their effects through:
- Universal perturbation detection.
- Cross-modal feature mapping.
- Adaptive defense adjustment.

---

## **Features**
- Detection of adversarial attacks across diverse domains.
- Defense through adaptive noise injection.
- Compatibility with image, text, and tabular data models.
- Scalable and domain-agnostic feature mapping using PCA and neural networks.

## **Installation**
To set up the repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/cdadm.git
   cd cdadm


## **Usage**

### 1. Generate Adversarial Samples
```python
from adversarial_attack_generation import generate_adversarial_samples
X_adv = generate_adversarial_samples(model, X_test, y_test)
```

### 2. Detect Adversarial Samples
```python
from adversarial_detection import detect_adversarial
flags = detect_adversarial(X_adv, model)
```

### 3. Apply CDADM Framework
```python
from cdadm_framework import cdadm_framework
results = cdadm_framework(X_adv, model)
print(results)
```
